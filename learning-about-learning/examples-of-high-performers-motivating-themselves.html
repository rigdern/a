<p>Below are examples of high performers taking actions to increase the chances that they will do a desired behavior. These high performers seem to be aware of their natural tendencies. They find ways to leverage their tendencies to help their desired behavior while mitigating any tendencies that might hinder it.</p>

Potential additional ideas to include:

(1)

Perhaps a useful concept is the disconnect that we can experience between what we think (our head) and what we feel (our heart). Here are a couple of examples to illustrate this concept:
- Texting while driving. Many people know that texting while driving a car is dangerous but don't feel any fear when doing it. The mind knows it's dangerous but the heart does not.
- Public speaking. Many people know that public speaking is a relatively safe activity yet are filled with fear while attempting it. The mind knows it's safe but the heart does not.

Having an awareness of and making strategic use of your heart (things to which you respond strongly) can increase the chances you'll behave in the way that you want. Leverage the tendencies that increase the chances you'll behave in the way that you want and mitigate those that decrease the chances. This seems to be what the high performers in the examples below have done.

(2)

Each of these examples is around a person influencing their behavior to perform better at their profession. None is about influencing behavior around a side task like a house chore. Why? Perhaps high performers only tell stories about how they motivate themselves to high performance in their profession. Or maybe these techniques aren't applicable to side tasks. Or maybe you want to reserve these techniques for the goals that are most important to you.

<h2 id="michael-jordan--competition">Michael Jordan &amp; competition</h2>
<p>Michael Jordan's biography on the NBA website states: &quot;By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.&quot;<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> He won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls between 1991 and 1998.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(miniseries)">The Last Dance</a> shares some anecdotes about how Michael Jordan motivated himself. He was highly motivated by <strong>competition</strong> and leveraged this source of motivation by inventing rivalries.</p>
<p>In a March 19, 1993 game between the Washington Bullets and the Chicago Bulls, LaBradford Smith scored 37 points against the Bulls, the most points LaBradford scored in a single game in his career.<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> &quot;And for whatever reason, Michael couldn't make a basket.&quot;<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> After the game, LaBradford approached Jordan and said &quot;Nice game, Mike.&quot; This infuriated Jordan. He told teammates, &quot;Tomorrow in the first half, I'm going to have what this kid had in the game.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, the Washington Bullets and the Chicago Bulls played each other again. Jordan ended the first half with 36 points, nearly hitting his ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of comments about Jordan's performance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He took such umbrage at a guy saying, &quot;Nice game, Mike,&quot; that he torched and humiliated him in front of 20,000 people.</p>
<p>— Michael Wilbon, The Washington Post writer 1980-2010<sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I've never seen a man go after another player the way he did.</p>
<p>— B.J. Armstrong, Chicago Bulls player 1989-1995<sup id="fnref-4-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decades later, in response to a rumor that a detail of the story was false, reporters asked Jordan whether LaBradford had really said to him &quot;Nice game, Mike.&quot; Jordan replied, &quot;No, I made it up.&quot;</p>
<p>To motivate himself to play hard, Jordan had pretended that LaBradford had insulted him! Throughout his career, he leveraged this technique of inventing rivalries, interpreting minor comments and actions as deep insults, to motivate himself to play hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These little slights were deep indignations to him. That's all he needs. That's like throwing meat to a tiger. He'd find a game within the game to keep him interested. But it was all in his mind.</p>
<p>— Mark Vancil, Author of Rare Air<sup id="fnref-4-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="richard-hamming--pride">Richard Hamming &amp; pride</h2>
<p>Richard Hamming was a mathematician who worked on the Manhattan Project, worked at Bell Labs, and invented the first error-correcting code.</p>
<p>Hamming realized that he was motivated by <strong>pride</strong> and leveraged this source of motivation by putting his pride on the line by promising results by specific dates. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past I have deliberately managed myself in this matter by promising a result by a given date, and then, like a cornered rat, having at the last minute to find something! I have been surprised at how often this simple trick of managing myself has worked for me. Of course it depends on having a great deal of pride and self-confidence.</p>

<h2 id="john-carmack--responsibility">John Carmack &amp; responsibility</h2>
<p>John Carmack is a self-taught computer programmer who has a reputation for his productivity. He has worked on state of the art video game engines (e.g. Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake), space vehicle development as a founder and head of Armadillo Aerospace, virtual reality as the Oculus CTO, and artificial general intelligence as an independent researcher.</p>
<p>Carmack has provided a couple of anecdotes of leveraging his tendencies to increase the chances of executing a desired behavior.</p>
<p>In working on his self-funded artificial intelligence research, he observed that he was meandering: he was spending too much time exploring things he found to be curious and too little time on the most important problems. He realized that he has <strong>an overactive sense of responsibility about other people's money</strong>. Consequently, although he could continue to self-fund his research indefinitely, he decided to accept external funding. He figured his sense of responsibility over the investors' money would be a forcing function to focus on the most important problems. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keen Technologies, my new AGI company, has raised a $20M round</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This is explicitly a focusing effort for me. I could write a $20M check myself, but knowing that other people's money is on the line engenders a greater sense of discipline and determination.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1560728045115375617">these tweets on 8/9/22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also discusses this on <a href="https://youtu.be/I845O57ZSy4?t=17323">Lex Fridman Podcast #309 at 4:48:43</a>.</p>
<p>Carmack shared another example where he realized he was avoiding running artificial intelligence experiments that required specialized hardware. To run such experiments, he had to rent time on specialized hardware provided by a cloud service. He seemed to avoid such experiments whenever he could even though the cost of renting time was negligible to him. To reverse the situation so that he'd be biased towards running such experiments, he purchased the expensive specialized hardware for his home. He figured this would bias him towards running experiments because, whenever his specialized hardware was sitting idle, he'd feel that it was being underutilized.<sup id="fnref-5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="twitch-founders--persisting-on-an-idea">Twitch founders &amp; persisting on an idea</h2>
<p>Twitch is a popular video live streaming service.</p>
<p>In the early days, the Twitch founding team was aware that they had a tendency to quickly give up on an idea to jump to another one. They realized they needed the opposite capability — they needed to be able to stick to an idea and see it through. To help them achieve this behavior, they hired Michael Seibel who had this desired tendency. They figured that Michael's tendency would act as a balancing force to the current team's tendency.<sup id="fnref-6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="reader-exercise">Reader exercise</h2>
<p>One technique for increasing the chances of doing a desired behavior is to follow the aforementioned examples.</p>
<p>Think about the behaviors you'd most like to do.</p>
<p>Reflect on your experiences and make a list of the things to which you respond the most strongly. For example, Michael Jordan responds strongly to <strong>competition</strong> while Richard Hamming responds strongly to putting his <strong>pride</strong> on the line.</p>
<p>Which of these things can be leveraged to increase the chances you'll complete your desired behavior? Which could hinder your desired behavior and should be mitigated?</p>
<p>If you have other examples of people leveraging/mitigating their natural tendencies to increase the chances of a desired behavior, I'd be interested to hear about them.</p>

<p>The story is based on this quote from Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin reflected, and noticed correctly, that we kind of had a highly distractible way of engaging with our startup where we wouldn't stay on target and we would jump at the new shiny thing. We got overly inspired too quickly. He basically thought we needed adult supervision, not like an older person but someone who would be a little more reasonable and steady. And Michael is a very steady, calm, and smart person. And Justin was like I think we need Michael on the team. In retrospect, he was totally right. Michael was an incredible addition.</p>
